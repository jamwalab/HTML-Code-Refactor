# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

>## [Link to the HTML page.](./index.html)   

>## List of some of the changes made to the file.

* Semantic HTML elements like header, footer, nav, section, article etc used.
* More descriptive title provided.
* Navigation bar id# link corrected.
* Homepage link added to the company logo.
* Header and footer classes removed, css now applies directly to the semantic tag.
* Common CSS code in the content and benefit section combined under a single class.
* Alt added to the images with text for relevant images.
* Heading added in sequential order without skipping.
* Git commits made after changing each section.
* CSS code consolidated together global, common and section code with comments.
* Commnets added to HTML page as well.
* Other minor changes to the code.
* _**Additional note:**_ When I changed the heading in the benefit section from h3 to h2, I applied the default font size of h3 element to the new h2 heading in benefit section but it looked smaller than that in the preview so I removed it and used the default h2 font size (which looks similar to the preview).
